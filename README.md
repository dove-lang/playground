<h2 align="center">A nice playground for the Dove Programming Language üïäÔ∏è</h1>

This is the main source code repository for the [Dove Playground](http://dove-lang.com/playground/).

### Features üí°
This playground allows you to run Dove code without installing the main Dove program ([Linux](https://github.com/dove-lang/dove/releases/download/v0.1.2/dove), [Windows](https://github.com/dove-lang/dove/releases/download/v0.1.2/dove.exe)).

1. Native Dove syntax highlighting support.
2. User friendly editor which is based on `monaco-editor`, the editor that powers [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).
3. Built-in examples of famous algorithms to give you a brief idea of what Dove is capable of.
4. The interpreter is compiled to `.wasm`, which enables:
    1. Fast speed,
    2. Offline interpreting.
    
### Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Does not support `import` statements.
